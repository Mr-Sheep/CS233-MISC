So this thing won't compile locally because I was unable to find the binary executable called `spim-vasm`

~~There's a [tutorial from previous year's website](https://cs233.github.io/oyom_wsl_intro.html) that has a [git repo](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs233-sp21/_shared.git)~~

use `spim-vasm` in bin
