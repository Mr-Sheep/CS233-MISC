Instructions

You may assume that the following constant is provided elsewhere via a header.

#define GRID_SQUARED = 16;

Translate the C code below to MIPS assembly. Use register conventions to determine which variable is assigned to which register. Do your best to follow the MIPS Style Guide. The MIPS Reference Guide in case you need it.

Do not implement has_single_bit_set. Write your code assuming that has_single_bit_set is implemented correctly in a different file and can be called using proper calling conventions.

We provide you with one test case in the .data segment. You can modify this test case to try different values in the debugger. Do not delete any test cases, add any new test cases, or change the sizing since it will break the debugger and cause test cases to fail.

```c
bool board_done(unsigned short board[GRID_SQUARED][GRID_SQUARED]) {
  for (int i = 0 ; i < GRID_SQUARED ; ++ i) {
    for (int j = 0 ; j < GRID_SQUARED ; ++ j) {
      if (!has_single_bit_set(board[i][j])) {
        return false;  // false is 0
      }
    }
  }
  return true;  // true is 1
}
```
