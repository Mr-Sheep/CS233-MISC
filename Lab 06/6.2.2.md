Instructions

You may assume that the following constant is provided elsewhere via a header.

`#define GRID_SQUARED = 16;`

The array symbollist is declared as a global variable that you can reference.

`const char symbollist[] = "0123456789ABCDEFG";`

Translate the C code below to MIPS assembly. Use register conventions to determine which variable is assigned to which register. Do your best to follow the MIPS Style Guide. The MIPS Reference Guide in case you need it.

Do not implement has_single_bit_set or get_lowest_set_bit. Write your code assuming that these functions are implemented correctly in a different file and can be called using proper calling conventions.


 We provide you with two test cases in the `.data` segment. You can modify these test case values to try different values in the debugger. Do not delete any test cases, add any new test cases, or change the sizing since it will break the debugger and cause test cases to fail.

```c
 void print_board(unsigned short board[GRID_SQUARED][GRID_SQUARED]) {
  for (int i = 0 ; i < GRID_SQUARED ; ++ i) {
    for (int j = 0 ; j < GRID_SQUARED ; ++ j) {
      unsigned value = board[i][j];
      char c = '*';
      if (has_single_bit_set(value)) {
        unsigned num = get_lowest_set_bit(value) + 1;
        c = symbollist[num];
      }
      printf("%c", c);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```
